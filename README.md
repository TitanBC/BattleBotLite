# BattleBotLite
a very very light DnD "combat simulation"
Just trying to get the hang of putting together a moderately entertaining program using 'dice rolls,' and giving the option of selecting a weapon and armor type. Monsters are randomly generated, and given random weapons/armor. Looking to add on to this later, including items such as potions and potentially spells to use as well. maybe more mechanics but one step at a time.
